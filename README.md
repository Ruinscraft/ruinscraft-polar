# ruinscraft-polar

ruinscraft-polar is the world generator for a survival gamemode prototype called Polar. This was an experimental gamemode intended for two groups of players: peaceful builders, and players who wanted resources and challenges.

The world is divided into two parts along the X axis. One side is peaceful with no hostile mobs and few underground resources. The other side is a featureless hell with huge risks and huge treasures.

The "Positive" side, with normal biomes, is plentiful of animals, food, trees, and lacks monsters. However, one may find it difficult to progress past stone/iron tools, as iron spawns 50% less, and there are no diamonds/redstone/lapis/lava/etc. One is also not able to go to the Nether.

The "Negative" side is lacking of biomes as it is all stone. Blocks placed randomly explode, monsters are buffed and move quickly, and other added features are major hurdles. The treasures you can find, however, make it worth it for many players. Ores are more plentiful, treasure chests are full of more goodies, structures are more frequent, and other secrets can be found.

Either side of the world gets more and more polarized the farther you go in. Mobs get harder and harder and loot gets better and better on the negative side, and less iron spawns and less loot chests are found while more animals spawn on the positive side.

I started working on this as a general concept in January 2019 after thinking of ways to replace our former Main server. I worked on this for a good month or so, and still wanted to add some more (nothing in the Nether/End has changed, for example). However, I became less interested in development and more confident that people wouldn't play it much, so I eventually ended development. Since some people were intrigued in what this was when I was working on it, I decided to write this out now.

Structures on the negative side are even more ruined than usual, and are usually in flames

The underwater villages in 1.13 are pretty much extra villages with the oceans gone on the negative side
